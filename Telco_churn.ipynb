The implications of high churn rates are:\n","\n","* Revenue Loss\n","* Decreased ROI on marketing\n","* Reputational Damage due to Customer dissatisfaction\n","* Reduced Market Share and Growth\n","* Lower Employee Morale\n","* Financial Uncertainty\n","\n","Due to this, Machne Learning and Advanced Analytics has proided us with the technologies to transform raw data into actions and insights. We will employ Classification models to get actionable insights.\n","\n","Classification in Machine Learning is a supervised learning approach where the computer program learns from provided data to make new observations by classifying. Various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting will be explored to identify the most effective model for the given dataset.\n","The **objective** is to determine the class or category into which new data points will fall. \n","\n","In this project, an elaborate analysis will be conducted to train at least some models for predicting customer churn in a telecom company. This analysis will adhere to the **CRISP-DM framework**, ensuring a structured and systematic approach to model development and evaluation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### 1.2 Project Objective\n","Objective of this project is to develop a classification model for churn analysis which is to predict whether customers are likely to leave or continue their relationship with the company. By identifying customers at risk of churning, the company can take proactive measures to retain them, thus increasing revenue and profit margins.\n","\n","### 1.3 Data Description\n","The project will utilize historical data that contains details on customer behaviours and transactional details.\n","Datasets will be retrieved from various sources including a database, GitHub repository and Onedrive.\n","\n","\n","### 1.4 Success metrics\n","- `Good:` accurately predicting churn at least 75% measured with the harmonic f1-score metric. \n","\n","- `Excellent:` accurately predicting churn at least 80%.\n","\n","\n","### 1.5 Hypothesis\n","**Hypothesis 1**\n","\n","`Null Hypothesis (Ho):` There is no significant difference in churn rates between customers with higher and lower monthly charge.\n","\n","`Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):` There is a significant difference in churn rates between customers with higher and lower monthly charge.\n","\n","\n","### 1.6 Business Questions\n","1. What is the average tenure of customers who churned compared to those who stayed?\n","2. Do customers with partners or dependents have a lower churn rate?\n","3. Is there a correlation between the contract term (Contract) and customer churn?\n","4. What are the common payment methods (Payment Method) among customers who churned?\n","5. How does the availability of tech-related services (e.g., OnlineSecurity, TechSupport) impact churn rates?\n","6. What percentage of customers who churned had streaming services (StreamingTV, StreamingMovies)?\n","7. How does the total amount charged to customers (TotalCharges) correlate with churn behavior?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 2.0 Data Understanding\n","\n","### 2.1 Inspecting the dataset in depth.\n","\n","A.
